### Relational Database
> I know more than this.
 
### Non Relational
I couldn't learn this very deeply,
well this comes later. (TiDB, Redis, MongoDB, etc.)

* Spreadsheets: Basic Excel knowledge
* NoSQL
  * Key-Value (hash table)
  * Graph
  * Columnar
  * Document (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.)

### Python
> SQL is not a real programming language.

* `Numpy`: multi-dimensional arrays
  * np\_array
* `Pandas`: relational tables
  * series
  * dataframe
* `Matplotlib`: data visualization
* `SciPy`: additional scientific functions

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import ... # you need to specify exact sub-packages that you need
```
