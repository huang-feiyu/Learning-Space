### Defining Data Science
> A separate paradigm of science
>
> * Empirical
> * Theoretical

> * Data-Driven

* Data
  * Structured
  * Semi-structured
  * Unstructured
* Data Science
  * Science field: probability and statistics
  * Gain information from data to apply to produce some actionable insights
* Sources of data
  * Structured Data: Internet of thing
  * Unstructured Data: Text, images, videos
  * Semi-structured Data: Social network
* Steps of data journey
  1. Data Acquisition
  2. Data Storage
  3. Data Processing
  4. Visualization/Human Insights
  5. Training predictive model

### Ethics
> We need to minimize potential harms and unintended consequences from our data-driven actions.

* Ethics: about the shared values and moral principles that govern our behavior in society
  * Data Ethics: studies and evaluates moral problems related to data, algorithms and corresponding practices
  * Applied Ethics: the practical application of moral considerations
  * Ethics Culture: about operationalizing applied ethics
* Ethics Concepts
  * Ethics Principles/Shared values
    * Accountability
    * Transparency
    * Fairness
    * Reliability & Safety
    * Privacy & Security
    * Inclusiveness
  * Ethics Challenges
    * Data Ownership  
    * Informed Consent
    * Intellectual Property
    * Data Privacy
    * Right To Be Forgotten
    * Dataset Bias
    * Data Quality
    * Algorithm Fairness
    * Misrepresentation
    * Free Choice
* Applied Ethics
  * Professional Code
  * Ethics Checklists
  * Ethics Regulations
* Ethics Culture

### Defining Data
* How to describe data
  * Raw Data: comes from its source in its initial state, needs to be organized into a understandable format
  * (定量数据)Quantitative Data: numerical observations
  * (定性数据)Qualitative Data: cannot be measured objectively
  * Structured Data: organized into rows and columns
    * spreadsheet, relational databases, phone numbers
  * Unstructured Data: doesn't contain a format or set of rules to follow
    * text files, videos files
  * Semi-Structured Data: a combination of structured data and unstructured data
    * CSV files, HTML, JSON 
* Sources of Data: Almost everywhere
  * Primary: generated by its user
  * Secondary: comes from a source that has collected data for general use
  
### Stats-and-probability
* Probability and Random Variables: The thing I am learning.
  * event: 事件
  * sample space: 样本空间
  * discrete: 离散的
* Probability Distribution: 概率分布
  * uniform distribution: 均匀分布
  * probability density function: 概率密度
  * normal distribution: 正态分布
  * Mean: 平均数
  * Variance: 方差
  * Standard Deviation: 标准差
  * Mode: 众数
  * Median: 中位数
  * Quartiles: 四分位数
* Law of Large Numbers: 大数定理
* Central Limit Theorem: 中心极限定理
* Covariance: 协方差
* Correlation: 相关性
