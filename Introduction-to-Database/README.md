### Q&A

* ~~Q1: Why do you post the first two videos but later not?~~

  A: Because I found my proxy was good enough to support me to finish the course. If you can not access the Videos, you can get it in [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bE411N79M). So enjoy the course, and be a better man.
  
* Q2: Why the videos above refers missing?

  A: Because I cannot push the repository in terminal, so I pushed it on the web page. And there is a limit that you can upload a file more than 25MB, so the books, zips, videos are all left in my computer disk. (Maybe the project is too large for my network to upload)
  
* ~~Q3: Why project#0 cannot work on the <a href=https://www.gradescope.com/courses/195440>GradeScope</a>?~~

  A: I want to know, too. I have been working on it for 2 whole days, but I still can not find answer. Maybe, my c++ skill is a little poor, so I can not find it out. So, let it go, it is my nightmare. Good Bye, the fucking primer project. I lose. (OK, I found where the problem is, I write a wrong filename.)
