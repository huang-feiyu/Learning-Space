因为希望能够系统地学习编程语言相关概念，所以我选择学习这一门课。

* [Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages): Functional programming
* [Part B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b): Dynamic and Static
* [Part C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c): Object-Oriented Programming

## Intro

Programming Languages 是一门连续的课程，需要使用十周的时间去学习。途中我们会使用 SML, Racket, Ruby. 以下是课程简单介绍： 

Part A:

* Syntax vs. semantics vs. idioms vs. libraries vs. tools
* ML basics (bindings, conditionals, records, functions)
* Recursive functions and recursive types
* Benefits of no mutation
* Algebraic datatypes, pattern matching
* Tail recursion
* Higher-order functions; closures
* Lexical scope
* Currying
* Syntactic sugar
* Equivalence and effects
* Parametric polymorphism and container types
* Type inference
* Abstract types and modules

Part B:

* Racket basics
* Dynamic vs. static typing
* Laziness, streams, and memoization
* Implementing languages, especially higher-order functions
* Macros
* Eval

Part C:

* Ruby basics
* Object-oriented programming is dynamic dispatch
* Pure object-orientation
* Implementing dynamic dispatch
* Multiple inheritance, interfaces, and mixins
* OOP vs. functional decomposition and extensibility
* Subtyping for records, functions, and objects
* Class-based subtyping
* Subtyping
* Subtyping vs. parametric polymorphism; bounded polymorphism
