## Reading 11: Abstraction Functions & Rep Invariants

> Mathematical notions:
> * Abstraction Functions: a way to cleanly define the equality operation on an abstract data type
> * Rep Invariant: easier to catch bugs caused by a corrupted data structure

* Invariants: a property that must be true for every valid state of an object
    * Immutability
    * Immutable wrappers around mtable data types, such as `Collections.unmodifiadbleList()`
* Rep invariant and abstraction function
    * abstract values: values that the type is designed to support
    * rep values: Java objects that actually implement the abstract values
    ![abstract value vs. rep value](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/11-abstraction-functions-rep-invariants/figures/charset-af-ri.svg)
    * Abstract Function: map rep values to the abstract values they represent `AF : R -> A`
    * Rep Invariant: map rep values to booleans `RI : R -> boolean`
    * Essential point: **ADT means not only choosing the two spaces, but also deciding which rep values are legal, and how to interpret them as abstract values**

No null values in the rep: implicitly includes `x != null` for every refernce `x` in the rep.

Example 1:

![Example 1](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/11-abstraction-functions-rep-invariants/figures/charset-norepeats.svg)
```java
public class CharSet {
    private String s;
    // Rep invariant:
    //   s contains no repeated characters
    // Abstraction function:
    //   AF(s) = {s[i] | 0 <= i < s.length()}
    ...
}
```

Example 2:

![Example 2](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/11-abstraction-functions-rep-invariants/figures/charset-sorted.svg)
```java
public class CharSet {
    private String s;
    // Rep invariant:
    //   s[0] <= s[1] <= ... <= s[s.length()-1]
    // Abstraction function:
    //   AF(s) = {s[i] | 0 <= i < s.length()}
    ...
}
```

Example 3:

![Example 3](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/11-abstraction-functions-rep-invariants/figures/charset-sortedrange.svg)
```java
public class CharSet {
    private String s;
    // Rep invariant:
    //   s.length() is even
    //   s[0] <= s[1] <= ... <= s[s.length()-1]
    // Abstraction function:
    //   AF(s) = union of { c | s[2i] <= c <= s[2i+1] }
    //           for all 0 <= i < s.length()/2
    ...
}
```

* Beneficent mutation: the abstract value should never change, it's free to mutate a rep value as long as it maps to the same abstract value
* Documenting: *precise*; *rep exposure safety from argument*

## Reading 12: Interface, Generic, Enum

* Interface: a list of method signatures without implementations
    * interface is all a client needs to know about
    * multiple different representations of ADT can coexist in the same program
    * Subtype: a *subtype* is simply a subset of the *supertype*
        * "B is a subtype of A" means "every B is an A"
* Subclassing
    * inherits the instance methods of its superclass
    * inherits the fields of its superclass
    * can override/add instance methods of its superclass
    * dynamic dispatch: the type of the object at runtime determines the method implementation to call
* Generic types
* Enumerations

## Reading 13: Debugging

* Reproduce the bug
    * start by finding a small, repeatable test case that produces the bug
* Find the bug using the scientific method after 10 minutes
    1. study the data
    2. hypothesize
        * use binary search to speed up the process
        * slcing to find the parts of a program that produce the bug
        * delta debugging: compare successful runs with failing runs; using vcs
    3. experiment
        * print clear and descriptive statement; logging; assertion; breakpoint
        * swap components with a different implementation that satisfies the same interface
        * one bug at a time
    4. repeat
        * Keep an andit trail
        * make sure source code and object code are up to date
        * bug is always there if you don't fix it

## Reading 14: Recursion

* recursive problems and recursive data
* comparing alternative decompositions of a recursive problem
* using helper methods to strengthen a recursive step
* recursion vs. iteration

## Reading 15: Equality

* Equality should be an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive).
* Equality and hash code must be consistent with each other, so that data structures that use hash tables (like HashSet and HashMap) work properly.
* The abstraction function is the basis for equality in immutable data types (which means immutable types must override equals(), and therefore hashCode()).
* Reference equality is the basis for equality in mutable data types; this is the only way to ensure consistency over time and avoid breaking rep invariants of hash tables.
