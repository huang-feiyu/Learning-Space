## Reading 11: Abstraction Functions & Rep Invariants

> Mathematical notions:
> * Abstraction Functions: a way to cleanly define the equality operation on an abstract data type
> * Rep Invariant: easier to catch bugs caused by a corrupted data structure

* Invariants: a property that must be true for every valid state of an object
    * Immutability
    * Immutable wrappers around mtable data types, such as `Collections.unmodifiadbleList()`
* Rep invariant and abstraction function
    * abstract values: values that the type is designed to support
    * rep values: Java objects that actually implement the abstract values
    ![abstract value vs. rep value](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/11-abstraction-functions-rep-invariants/figures/charset-af-ri.svg)
    * Abstract Function: map rep values to the abstract values they represent `AF : R -> A`
    * Rep Invariant: map rep values to booleans `RI : R -> boolean`
    * Essential point: **ADT means not only choosing the two spaces, but also deciding which rep values are legal, and how to interpret them as abstract values**

No null values in the rep: implicitly includes `x != null` for every refernce `x` in the rep.

Example 1:

![Example 1](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/11-abstraction-functions-rep-invariants/figures/charset-norepeats.svg)
```java
public class CharSet {
    private String s;
    // Rep invariant:
    //   s contains no repeated characters
    // Abstraction function:
    //   AF(s) = {s[i] | 0 <= i < s.length()}
    ...
}
```

Example 2:

![Example 2](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/11-abstraction-functions-rep-invariants/figures/charset-sorted.svg)
```java
public class CharSet {
    private String s;
    // Rep invariant:
    //   s[0] <= s[1] <= ... <= s[s.length()-1]
    // Abstraction function:
    //   AF(s) = {s[i] | 0 <= i < s.length()}
    ...
}
```

Example 3:

![Example 3](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/11-abstraction-functions-rep-invariants/figures/charset-sortedrange.svg)
```java
public class CharSet {
    private String s;
    // Rep invariant:
    //   s.length() is even
    //   s[0] <= s[1] <= ... <= s[s.length()-1]
    // Abstraction function:
    //   AF(s) = union of { c | s[2i] <= c <= s[2i+1] }
    //           for all 0 <= i < s.length()/2
    ...
}
```

* Beneficent mutation: the abstract value should never change, it's free to mutate a rep value as long as it maps to the same abstract value
* Documenting: *precise*; *rep exposure safety from argument*

## Reading 12: Interface, Generic, Enum

* Interface: a list of method signatures without implementations
    * interface is all a client needs to know about
    * multiple different representations of ADT can coexist in the same program
    * Subtype: a *subtype* is simply a subset of the *supertype*
        * "B is a subtype of A" means "every B is an A"
* Subclassing
    * inherits the instance methods of its superclass
    * inherits the fields of its superclass
    * can override/add instance methods of its superclass
    * dynamic dispatch: the type of the object at runtime determines the method implementation to call
* Generic types
* Enumerations

## Reading 13: Debugging

* Reproduce the bug
    * start by finding a small, repeatable test case that produces the bug
* Find the bug using the scientific method after 10 minutes
    1. study the data
    2. hypothesize
        * use binary search to speed up the process
        * slcing to find the parts of a program that produce the bug
        * delta debugging: compare successful runs with failing runs; using vcs
    3. experiment
        * print clear and descriptive statement; logging; assertion; breakpoint
        * swap components with a different implementation that satisfies the same interface
        * one bug at a time
    4. repeat
        * Keep an andit trail
        * make sure source code and object code are up to date
        * bug is always there if you don't fix it

## Reading 14: Recursion

* recursive problems and recursive data
* comparing alternative decompositions of a recursive problem
* using helper methods to strengthen a recursive step
* recursion vs. iteration

## Reading 15: Equality

* Equality should be an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive).
* Equality and hash code must be consistent with each other, so that data structures that use hash tables (like HashSet and HashMap) work properly.
* The abstraction function is the basis for equality in immutable data types (which means immutable types must override equals(), and therefore hashCode()).
* Reference equality is the basis for equality in mutable data types; this is the only way to ensure consistency over time and avoid breaking rep invariants of hash tables.

## Reading 16: Recursive Data Types

> 与形式语言定义有些类似.

For example, `List` in Racket written in java `ImList`
* datatype definition: `ImList<E> = Empty + Cons(elt:E, rest:ImList<E>)`
* functions over recursive datatypes:
  ```
  isEmpty(Empty) = true
  isEmpty(Cons(elt:E, rest:ImList)) = false

  append(Empty, list2:ImList) = list2
  append(Cons(elt:E, rest:ImList), list2:ImList) = cons(elt, append(rest, list2))
  ```

---

* datatype definitions: a powerful way to think about abstract types, particularly recursive ones
* functions over recursive datatypes: declared in the specification for the type, and implemented with one case per concrete variant
* immutable lists: a classic, canonical example of an immutable datatype

## Reading 17: Regular Expressions & Grammars

> Again, with formal language and automata theory. It's time to review formal language and automata theory.

Machine-processed textual languages are ubiquitous in computer science. Grammars are the most popular formalism for describing such languages, and regular expressions are an important subclass of grammars that can be expressed without recursion.

## Reading 18: Parsers

* Parser generator: takes a grammar as input and automatically generates a parser (parse tree)
* Using ParserLib grammar

## Reading 19: Writing a Program with Abstract Data Types

An example.

## Reading 20: Concurrency

> You can't tell by looking at an eexpression whether it will be safe from race conditions.

* Concurrency: multiple computations running simultaneously
* Shared-memory & message-passing paradigms
* Processes & threads
    * Process is like a virtual computer; thread is like a virtual processor
* Race conditions
    * When correctness of result (postconditions and invariants) depends on the relative timing of events
