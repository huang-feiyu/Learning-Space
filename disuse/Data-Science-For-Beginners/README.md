### Data-Science-for-Beginners

> Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are pleased to offer a 10-week, 20-lesson curriculum all about Data Science. Each lesson includes pre-lesson and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, and an assignment. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

The course is provided by Microsoft. Everything is in its [Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners).

##### Short-Introduction

The repository mainly includes my pre-class exercises, after-class exercises, and notes for each class.
